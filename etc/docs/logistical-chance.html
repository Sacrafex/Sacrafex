<h1>Logistical Chance of God (Christian)</h1>

<section>
  <h2>Cosmological Arguments</h2>
  <p><strong>Premise 1:</strong> Everything that starts has a cause within spacetime.</p>
  <p><strong>Additional Fact:</strong> <em>Ex nihilo nihil fit</em> is a popular philosophical idea popularized greatly.</p>
  <p><strong>Premise 2:</strong> The universe began to exist (supported by the second law of thermodynamics implying a finite past). We can see this finite past in the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem.</p>
  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The universe requires an uncaused cause to explain its origin without development from matter, space, or time.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Teleological Arguments</h2>
  <p><strong>Premise 1:</strong> The universe has a fine-tuning for life (e.g. cosmological constant, proton-electron mass ratio).</p>
  <p><strong>Premise 2:</strong> The probability of this fine-tuning occurring by chance is very very low. We are talking 1 in 10<sup>120</sup> for the cosmological constant alone.</p>
  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The only explanation for such fine tuning for life is an intelligent designer.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Moral Argument</h2>
  <p><strong>Premise 1:</strong> Objective moral values exist (e.g. “Murder”).</p>
  <p><strong>Premise 2:</strong> Moral values require an authority to ground this reason.</p>
  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> An external being with authority assigns specific moralities defined to us.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Consciousness Argument</h2>
  <p><strong>Premise 1:</strong> Consciousness cannot be reduced to physical processes.</p>
  <p><strong>Premise 2:</strong> A universe creating self-aware, intentional beings is far more likely due to theism.</p>
  <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The existence of consciousness supports a divine mind.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Mathematical Arguments</h2>
  <div class="formula">
P(G|E) = 
───────────────
P(G)·P(E|G) + P(¬G)·P(E|¬G)  
    P(G)·P(E|G)
  </div>

  <p>We will assign <em>P(G) = P(¬G) = 0.5</em> as neutral prior.</p>
  <p>Cosmic Beginning: <em>P(E₁|G) / P(E₁|¬G) = 5</em></p>
  <p>Fine-Tuning: <em>P(E₂|G) / P(E₂|¬G) = 10</em></p>
  <p>Consciousness: <em>P(E₃|G) / P(E₃|¬G) = 3</em></p>
  <p>Moral Law: <em>P(E₄|G) / P(E₄|¬G) = 2</em></p>
  <p><strong>P(G|E)</strong> taking into account these factors lands to about <strong>99.67%</strong> chance. Even with more conservative factors and removing any one of these, the chance will remain above 95%.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Testimony of the Apostles</h2>
  <p>Jesus was crucified under Pontius Pilate.</p>
  <p>His tomb was reportedly found empty.</p>
  <p>His followers claimed to see Him alive after death.</p>
  <p>These followers (especially the apostles) were willing to suffer and die for that claim.</p>
  <p>The church exploded in growth despite how outcast this was to their society.</p>
  <p><strong>What are the odds they ALL lied or were deceived?</strong></p>
  <p>There are two options:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>They told the truth about witnessing the risen Jesus Christ.</li>
    <li>Or they lied or were wrong.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Assuming independent decision-making, and generously estimating that 1 in 10,000 would die for a known lie, the chance ALL lied and chose martyrdom is:</p>
  <div class="formula">(1/10,000)<sup>12</sup> = 1 in 10<sup>48</sup></div>
  <p>Mathematically indistinguishable from impossible.</p>

  <p>What if they were deceived or hallucinated?</p>
  <p>Hallucinations are internal experiences, often linked to mental illness or drugs, and never documented at large scale group with physical interactions.</p>
  <p>Chance all hallucinated: <div class="formula">(1/1,000,000)<sup>12</sup> = 1 in 10<sup>72</sup></div></p>
  <p>Lying? Basically impossible. Hallucination? Astronomically unlikely. Sincere mistake? Not really, they acted with Him over days, not a single moment.</p>
  <p><strong>Overall conclusion:</strong> The chance of this happening out of chance given generous estimation is 1 in 10<sup>306</sup>.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Alternative Hypotheses</h2>
  <p>Some suggest naturalistic explanations instead of divine ones:</p>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Eternal Universe</h3>
    <p>The universe always existed with no beginning, avoiding the need for an uncaused cause. But this conflicts with the second law of thermodynamics and the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin theorem, which strongly suggest a finite past.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Multiverse Theory</h3>
    <p>Fine-tuning is explained by countless universes with varying constants, and we just happen to be in the right one? This remains speculative with no direct evidence, making it less compelling than intelligent design. It also really has no support outside of random speculation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Collective Hallucination or Mass Delusion</h3>
    <p>The resurrection appearances were hallucinations or myths. But hallucinations don’t happen on large scales with physical interaction, and the apostles’ willingness to die argues for sincerity.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="subsection">
    <h3>Moral Relativism</h3>
    <p>Moral values arise from social contracts or evolution, not an external authority. However, this fails to explain universal moral obligations felt across cultures. A universal moral decision on certain ideas of topics.</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Cognitive Biases and Limits of Human Understanding</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Confirmation Bias:</strong> Favoring information that supports preexisting beliefs.</li>
    <li><strong>Psychological Needs:</strong> Desire for meaning or order influencing belief in a divine cause.</li>
    <li><strong>Limits of Science:</strong> Science focuses on observable/testable phenomena; It is an impossibility for science to show supernaturalism. As the word is written, it is Super-Natural - Super meaning above & natural meaning of the natural world.</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<p>So at this point it seems obvious. What else is there to say? The numbers add up and it is most likely a eternal being (God) exists.</p>
