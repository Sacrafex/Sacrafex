<div class="doc-title">The True Christian Perspective on Abortion</div>

<p>Christians believe life is sacred and this is clearly noted in the Holy Bible. For example, in <strong>Psalm 139:13-14</strong> it says that God, “knit me together in my mother’s womb.” This alone states that life begins before birth, even before a heartbeat. This means abortion isn’t just a medical decision by doctors, but abortion is the ending of life that God created.</p>

<p>We also believe all humans are made in God’s image according to <strong>Genesis 1:27</strong>, which states, “So God created mankind in His own image.” This includes the unborn. Stating a fetus isn’t human yet goes against what the Bible says. If a baby in the womb is known and loved by God, it already has its value.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, some argue it's about, “Women's Rights”. But this argument fails tremendously. We believe God has the ultimate authority and is the author of life. Our decisions cannot affect God’s decisions. We don’t believe rights override righteousness. God gave humans free will, but not to justify sin. For example, though I have the free will to commit horrible crimes, I do not because it is against the morality of Holy Scriptures. Killing a baby isn’t moral even if it's legal.</p>

<p>Another argument is in the case of poverty or abuse and that abortion is “better” for the child. Wrong. Ending a life because it might be hard is not compassion, but a surrender instead. We believe in the idea of the future even in bad situations. The bad situation we are put in is due to sin. We are the reason we are even thinking about these decisions. Furthermore, churches often try to support needy mothers by offering adoption help.</p>

<p>Another argument is, “What about rape?” This is a serious sinful issue. But even in these cases, two wrongs do not at all make a right. The rapist deserves punishment, not the child. The child was not the one that committed the crime. We are called to protect others, not ignore their voices which cannot speak.</p>

<p>Is it human? Yes. This isn’t a religious opinion, but biology 101. DNA is set at conception. At the moment the sperm meets egg, a new genetic code forms. This is human DNA. This code has never existed before, and will likely never exist again. It’s not just the mother or just the father, but a new and different being. Here are the questions we ask:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is it alive? <strong>Yes, it is.</strong></li>
  <li>Does it have human DNA? <strong>Yes, it does.</strong></li>
  <li>Is it growing and developing? <strong>Yes, it is constantly.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Then what is it? A human being. We don’t base if someone is a person or not by size, development, or location. A premature baby isn’t any less human than a full-term baby. A 4-week fetus isn’t less human because it’s inside the womb. Size doesn’t determine this value. The species does. We can back this up by religious text. <strong>Jeremiah 1:5</strong> states, “Before I formed you in the womb I knew you.” or <strong>Luke 1:41</strong> where John the Baptist leapt in the womb when he encountered Jesus in Mary’s womb. This is a fetal-to-fetal recognition.</p>

<p>It is vital to be clear that this stance doesn’t disregard women. We are pro-human life. We value both the mother and child greatly. <strong>Proverbs 31:8</strong> says, “Speak up for those who cannot speak for themselves.”</p>
