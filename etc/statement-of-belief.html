      <center>Statement of Belief (November 2025) - Killian Zabinsky</center>

      <section id="opening">
        <h2>Opening Statement</h2>
        <p>
          This document outlines my beliefs regarding the world, creation, and the role of God. It reflects my understanding of scripture, nature, and faith.
        </p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="science">
        <h2>Science and the Supernatural</h2>
        <p>
          I affirm the study of the natural world through science, which provides evidence and understanding of creation. Science cannot, however, fully explain the supernatural. God operates beyond natural laws, and the supernatural is the ultimate source of all that exists.
        </p>
        <p>
          God created science and math as the building blocks of creation, with constants that reflect His design. Evidence from evolution, vestigial structures, transitional fossils, and DNA sequencing suggests life evolves, likely guided by God (Theistic Evolution). Other theories, like simulation theory, do not contradict God, as He could be the controller of such a system.

      <section id="solas">
        <h2>Solas</h2>
        <p>
          I acknowledge all five solas — <strong>Sola Scriptura, Sola Christus, Sola Fide, Sola Gratia,</strong> and
          <strong>Soli Deo Gloria</strong> — as guiding principles. They emphasize the <em>authority of God's Word</em>. Scripture is divinely inspired and serves as the ultimate reference for faith and practice.
        </p>
        <p>
          While the church may guide the faithful, it <strong>should not alter the scriptures</strong>. Tradition may be respected, but scripture takes precedence whenever conflicts arise.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr />

      <section id="mary">
        <h2>Mary</h2>
        <p>
          Mary deserves respect as the virgin who gave birth to Jesus Christ. I do not pray to Mary, because the Bible identifies Jesus as the sole mediator between God and humanity. Respecting Mary is not the same as worship or idolatry.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr />

      <section id="communion">
        <h2>Communion</h2>
        <p>
          I believe the bread and wine of communion are the true body and blood of Jesus Christ. I accept this as He stated in scripture (Matthew 26:26–28) without claiming to define the exact nature of the transformation. It remains a divine mystery.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr />

      <section id="baptism">
        <h2>Baptism</h2>
        <p>
          Baptism is a gift from God that welcomes individuals into the faith community. Infant baptism is valid, as it reflects God’s covenant rather than personal choice, though baptism at an older age is also appropriate.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr />

      <section id="second-coming-eschatology">
        <h2>The Second Coming and Eschatology</h2>
        <p>
          Christ will return bodily and visibly to judge the living and the dead. The righteous will be granted eternal life, while the unrepentant will face eternal punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do not believe in a Pre-Tribulation rapture, which is a later theological invention. Instead, Christ’s return will follow the Tribulation, aligning with scriptural teaching on enduring trials.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hold an amillennial view, interpreting the thousand years of Revelation 20 symbolically. Christ’s kingdom is already present, and this approach aligns with historical interpretation.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr />

      <section id="the-church">
        <h2>The Church</h2>
        <p>
          The Church is the body of Christ, encompassing all believers. No single denomination holds the full truth, though some interpretations are more accurate. God’s presence and miracles can occur in any faithful community.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr />

      <section id="sin-and-humanity">
        <h2>Sin and Humanity</h2>
        <p>
          Humanity is created in God’s image but falls short due to sin. Salvation is only possible through Christ. While God’s judgment is just, His grace provides reconciliation for those who follow Him.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr />

      <section id="scripture">
        <h2>Scripture</h2>
        <p>
          The Bible is the inspired, inerrant, and sufficient Word of God. It is the final authority for faith and life. Scripture does not change with culture, and any tradition or teaching must align with its truth.
        </p>
      </section>

      <hr />

      <section id="overall">
        <p>
          In conclusion, believers are part of God’s kingdom through baptism and faith. Salvation is by grace, not by works alone, though good works demonstrate faith and commitment to God.
