        <h2>Opening Statement</h2>
        <p>
         The purpose of this writing is to describe my specific beliefs on certain doctrines and teachings so I have a direct document explaining specifics without saying I am, "Lutheran" or whatever denomination or sect is most close. As shown, all denominations withhold salvation in a way, but it is still vitally important we get the specifics correct when it comes to this.

      <section id="solas">
        <h2>Solas</h2>
        <p>
          I acknowledge all five solas — <strong>Sola Scriptura, Sola Christus, Sola Fide, Sola Gratia,</strong> and
          <strong>Soli Deo Gloria</strong> — as important principles to understand. They emphasize the <em>infallibility of God's Word</em> over human fallibility. The Bible is a direct reference to His Word and was divinely inspired, as shown through Jesus Christ and His Apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I agree the church can make decisions, it <strong>should not alter the scriptures in any way</strong>. I do not intend to defend these ideas in theological or liturgical debates because there is no scriptural evidence supporting altering scripture, and some large denominations like the Roman Catholic Church contradict this teaching.

      <section id="mary">
        <h2>Mary</h2>
        <p>
          I believe Mary deserves great respect as the virgin who gave birth to Jesus Christ. However, I don’t believe we should pray to Mary. Many confuse praying to Mary with worship and idolatry, but they are <em>not</em> the same. I don’t agree with praying to Mary, but it is <strong>not worship or idolatry</strong>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          My reason for not praying to Mary is that there’s no biblical basis, and Jesus is the only mediator between God and humanity.<br />
          To clarify, the Bible doesn’t explicitly forbid praying to others like saints or Mary, but I personally choose not to because I’m unsure.

      <section id="communion">
        <h2>Communion</h2>
        <p>
          I believe the bread and wine taken at communion are the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. I won’t speculate beyond this, but as far as we know, this is exactly what Jesus Himself stated. I take Jesus at His word — "This is my body... this is my blood" (Matthew 26:26–28). I don’t go beyond what’s written.

      <section id="baptism">
        <h2>Baptism</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in <strong>infant baptism</strong> because baptism is not a personal affirmation of faith but a gift from God, welcoming the baptized into the faith community. Of course, baptism at an older age is completely fine too. Regardless of age, baptism is a way to join the Christian community and be welcomed in. Baptism is a gift from God — a sign of His covenant — not just a personal choice. It's how He welcomes us into the body of Christ, at any age.

      <section id="second-coming-eschatology">
        <h2>The Second Coming of Christ and Eschatology</h2>
        <p>
          I believe Christ will return bodily and visibly, as described in the New Testament. On His return, He will judge all people — the living and the dead. Everyone will be resurrected, including blasphemers, the unrepentant, and unbelievers. The righteous will be raised to eternal life on the new earth, while unbelievers and blasphemers will face eternal punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do <strong>not</strong> believe in the Pre-Tribulation rapture. This idea was invented by John Nelson Darby in 1827 and popularized, but it takes the Bible out of context. Instead, I believe in the <strong>Post-Tribulation rapture</strong> — that He will come after the Tribulation. The idea of a pre-Tribulation rapture gives believers a spiritual “pass” before suffering, which doesn’t match the suffering Christ said we’d endure (John 16:33). I reject it on both historical and scriptural grounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also believe in <strong>amillennialism</strong>, which interprets the thousand years of Revelation 20 symbolically, not literally. It states that Christ’s kingdom is already present now. This fits the fact that more than a thousand years have passed with no literal fulfillment, and it has a stronger historical foundation compared to newer Pre-Tribulation views.

      <section id="science">
        <h2>Science</h2>
        <p>
          I fully affirm science and the study of the natural world. But science, by definition, can't touch the supernatural. Supernatural is superior and over the natural world. There is a clear distinction between natural and supernatural events. Science studies the natural world and cannot prove or disprove God. Supernatural events observed by many people are the foundation for faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          God created science and math — the building blocks of the earth, along with constants that cannot change without supernatural cause. Arguments like the Cosmological and Transcendental show a powerful being started everything. Because we exist within time and space, we are limited in what we see and understand. God is not constrained by time, which is beyond our full comprehension.

      <section id="predestination">
        <h2>Predestination</h2>
        <p>
          Predestination is part of God's eternal plan, allowing anyone to respond to His grace. Creation will be renewed on Judgment Day. Predestination does not deny free will, nor does God predestine anyone away from His kingdom.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          It’s irrational and unscriptural to guess someone’s predestination. God is all-knowing and knows your destination.<br />
          This is biblical — refer to Romans, Ephesians, Thessalonians, and implied in John.

      <section id="the-church">
      <h2>The Church</h2>
        <p>
          The Church is the body of Christ and the grouping of all Christians. It exists to proclaim the gospel, administer the sacraments, build up the body, and worship God in Spirit and in truth. No single denomination or sect owns the truth fully. Some may be more accurate than others, but none are fully correct. In any sect or denomination, there is divine miracles and presence.
        </p>

      <section id="sin-and-humanity">
  <h2>Sin and Humanity</h2>
  <p>
    All people are made in the image of God but fall short because of sin. Sin separates us from God and brings spiritual death. Only through Christ’s atoning work can we be reconciled to God. We cannot do things on this earth to remove of our sin. At birth we have fallen short of the glory. It is impossible for one to achieve salvation without Jesus Christ. This is not saying that one who hasn't heard His message will not be saved, but is is stating that the only way is throught Christ Alone (Solo Christo).
  </p>
</section>

      <section id="scripture">
  <h2>Scripture</h2>
  <p>
    I believe the entirety of the Bible is the inspired. It is the inerrant Word of God and sufficient for all faith and life. It is the final authority in all matters of doctrine and practice (Sola Scriptura). God's truth does not evolve with culture. We have seen this cause horrid ideas and it does not belong to this. We do not ignore tradition, but leave it and if anything concflicts, prioritize Holy Scriptures.

      <section id="overall">
        <p>
          Overall, all believers are part of God’s glorious kingdom and baptised into his name. By grace we have been saved, not by our own doing. We show our faith through works, demonstrating our commitment to God.
