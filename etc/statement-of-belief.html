      <section id="solas">
        <h1>Solas</h1>
        <p>
          I acknowledge all five solas — <strong>Sola Scriptura, Sola Christus, Sola Fide, Sola Gratia,</strong> and
          <strong>Soli Deo Gloria</strong> — as important principles to understand. They emphasize the <em>infallibility of God's Word</em> over human fallibility. The Bible is a direct reference to His Word and was divinely inspired, as shown through Jesus Christ and His Apostles.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I agree the church can make decisions, it <strong>should not alter the scriptures in any way</strong>. I do not intend to defend these ideas in theological or liturgical debates because there is no scriptural evidence supporting altering scripture, and some large denominations like the Roman Catholic Church contradict this teaching.

      <section id="mary">
        <h2>Mary</h2>
        <p>
          I believe Mary deserves great respect as the virgin who gave birth to Jesus Christ. However, I don’t believe we should pray to Mary. Many confuse praying to Mary with worship and idolatry, but they are <em>not</em> the same. I don’t agree with praying to Mary, but it is <strong>not worship or idolatry</strong>.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          My reason for not praying to Mary is that there’s no biblical basis, and Jesus is the only mediator between God and humanity.<br />
          To clarify, the Bible doesn’t explicitly forbid praying to others like saints or Mary, but I personally choose not to because I’m unsure.

        <h2>Communion</h2>
        <p>
          I believe the bread and wine taken at communion are the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. I won’t speculate beyond this, but as far as we know, this is exactly what Jesus Himself stated.

      <section id="baptism">
        <h2>Baptism</h2>
        <p>
          I believe in <strong>infant baptism</strong> because baptism is not a personal affirmation of faith but a gift from God, welcoming the baptized into the faith community. Of course, baptism at an older age is completely fine too. Regardless of age, baptism is a way to join the Christian community and be welcomed in.

      <section id="second-coming-eschatology">
        <h2>The Second Coming of Christ and Eschatology</h2>
        <p>
          I believe Christ will return bodily and visibly, as described in the New Testament. On His return, He will judge all people — the living and the dead. Everyone will be resurrected, including blasphemers, the unrepentant, and unbelievers. The righteous will be raised to eternal life on the new earth, while unbelievers and blasphemers will face eternal punishment.
        </p>
        <p>
          I do <strong>not</strong> believe in the Pre-Tribulation rapture. This idea was invented by John Nelson Darby in 1827 and popularized, but it takes the Bible out of context. Instead, I believe in the <strong>Post-Tribulation rapture</strong> — that He will come after the Tribulation. The idea that believers get an exception before the Tribulation is a pre-suffering judgment, which I reject.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also believe in <strong>amillennialism</strong>, which interprets the thousand years of Revelation 20 symbolically, not literally. It states that Christ’s kingdom is already present now. This fits the fact that more than a thousand years have passed with no literal fulfillment, and it has a stronger historical foundation compared to newer Pre-Tribulation views.

      <section id="science">
        <h2>Science</h2>
        <p>
          I firmly believe in all science. There is a clear distinction between natural and supernatural events. Science studies the natural world and cannot prove or disprove God. Supernatural events observed by many people are the foundation for faith.
        </p>
        <p>
          God created science and math — the building blocks of the earth, along with constants that cannot change without supernatural cause. Arguments like the Cosmological and Transcendental show a powerful being started everything. Because we exist within time and space, we are limited in what we see and understand. God is not constrained by time, which is beyond our full comprehension.

      <section id="predestination">
        <h2>Predestination</h2>
        <p>
          Predestination is part of God's eternal plan, allowing anyone to respond to His grace. Creation will be renewed on Judgment Day. Predestination does not deny free will, nor does God predestine anyone away from His kingdom.
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          It’s irrational and unscriptural to guess someone’s predestination. God is all-knowing and knows your destination.<br />
          This is biblical — refer to Romans, Ephesians, Thessalonians, and implied in John.
        </blockquote>

      <section id="overall">
        <p>
          Overall, we are all part of God’s glorious kingdom. By grace we have been saved, not by our own doing. We show our faith through works, demonstrating our commitment to God.
