### About Me

**Sacrafex (Killian Zabinsky)** — The Official Unofficial fun guy. I am a free-time **biker**, a **off-roader**, **mechanic**, **technician**, and **professional button-pusher**. I enjoy vehicles especially the Jeep or Defender lineup. My favorite vehicle is the legendary **Jeep Wrangler Rubicon JLU 4x4**. I am the project manager and original author of VorosiumOS, an open-source operating system designed to be free of bloat, infinately customizable, and completely free to use. To prevent companies from redistributing the operating system, it is officially owned by Killian Zabinsky and is under a custom license.

### Hobbies

- Off Roading - I love offroading in the desert or in Colorado. It is something I look forward to every year.
- Music - I am a free-time pianist, organist, drummer, and pre-release guitarist.
- Programming - In my free time I work on large projects aiming to improve society like my largest project, Vorosium.
- Biking - Occasionally I find myself biking around my city and building endurance.
- Mechanics - Periodically I will try to work on mechanics of vehicles and other mechanical systems.
